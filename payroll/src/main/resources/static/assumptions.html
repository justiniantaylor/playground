         <h3>Web Front End</h3>
         <p>
         	I have not paid much special attention to the web front end portion, as I assumed the requirement was the payslip calculation service. I was considering just setting 
         	up Swagger to allow the assignment assessor to interact with the service, however I decided to opt for the simplest option for the assessor and just write a basic front end.

         <h3>Start Payment Date</h3>
         <p>
         	The assumption was that there was either a missing input parameter indicating the tax period / year, or that the start payment date range string was missing the year. 
         	In a real world scenario I would have requested a re-contract of the interface with the service client if possible to better bind the input parameters to their data types. 
        	However for this immediate requirement I decided to just include the year in the start payment date range string, ie. "01 March <b>2012</b> - 31 March <b>2012</b>".
