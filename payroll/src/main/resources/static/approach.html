         <p>The assumption was that there was either a missing input parameter indicating the tax period / year, or that the start payment date range string was missing the year. 
         In a real world scenario I would have requested recontracting the interface with the service client if possible to better bind the input parameters to their data types. 
         However for this immediate requirement I just decided to include the year in the start payment date range string, ie. "01 March <b>2012</b> - 31 March <b>2012</b>".</p>
