         <h3>Source Code</h3>
         <p>All the source code for this project is available on Github. I have created a repository called playground for my demo and prototypes.</p>
         <p>This particular technical assessment is in the only project in there at the moment called payroll: <a href="https://github.com/justiniantaylor/playground">View source on GitHub</a></p>

         <h3>Spring Boot</h3>
         <p>I decided to use a micro service pattern for this assignment, so opted to use Spring Boot with a rest web service. I generally would package this service a bit differently, I would follow a naming convention, as well as not put any web pages into the service project, but to keep things simple for the code review I opted to include the web and resource portions together in one project.</p>

         <h3>Security</h3>
         <p>I opted to keep things simple and not include any security for this assignment, I could very easily leverage spring security into my boot application by adding the spring security maven dependency, 
            doing some minor configuration and then be up and running with basic auth and csrf protection. I have done some more advanced security setups with an edge architecture / API Gateway using Spring Cloud deployed into a network DMZ and using spring session and redis for sharing auth state, but 
            I thought replicating that setup would be too much for this assignment.</p>

         <h3>Database</h3>
         <p>Once again to keep things simple I used an H2 in memory SQL database to store my tax rate periods and rates in. I will hand write the DDL and setup up a mysql database in Amazon RDS if you would prefer me to do so.<p>

         <h3>Service</h3>
         <p>I have encapsulated this business logic into a spring service component so that we may re-use this logic for multiple interfaces (Rest, SOAP etc), batch processes or events for this service and not be stuck with all the logic inside the rest controller.<p>

         <h3>Web</h3>
         <p>I have created this very basic front end so that the assignment assessor may interact with the service and test the logic. I used AngularJS which I am very familiar with, but opted to try something new instead of bootstrap and tried angular material for the first time.<p>

         <h3>Testing</h3>
         <p>I have written two tests in JUnit, one to test the rest service / controller (integration test with MockMvc), and the other to test the service logic.<p>

         <p>I have code commented throughout to give indication to the code reviewer the logic that was followed. I have also written and generated the Javadocs (see github).<p>
