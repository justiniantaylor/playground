# Toy Robot Simulator

## Requirements

### Description

* The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop,
  of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.
* There are no other obstructions on the table surface.
* The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be
  prevented from falling to destruction. Any movement that would result in the
  robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid
  movement commands must still be allowed.

Create an application that can read in commands of the following form:

    PLACE X,Y,F
    MOVE
    LEFT
    RIGHT
    REPORT

* PLACE will put the toy robot on the table in position X,Y and facing NORTH,
  SOUTH, EAST or WEST.
* The origin (0,0) can be considered to be the SOUTH WEST most corner.
* The first valid command to the robot is a PLACE command, after that, any
  sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another PLACE
  command. The application should discard all commands in the sequence until
  a valid PLACE command has been executed.
* MOVE will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is
  currently facing.
* LEFT and RIGHT will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction
  without changing the position of the robot.
* REPORT will announce the X,Y and F of the robot. This can be in any form,
  but standard output is sufficient.

* A robot that is not on the table can choose the ignore the MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT
  and REPORT commands.
* Input can be from a file, or from standard input, as the developer chooses.
* Provide test data to exercise the application.

### Constraints

* The toy robot must not fall off the table during movement. This also
  includes the initial placement of the toy robot.
* Any move that would cause the robot to fall must be ignored.

### Example Input and Output

#### Example a

    PLACE 0,0,NORTH
    MOVE
    REPORT

Expected output:

    0,1,NORTH

#### Example b

    PLACE 0,0,NORTH
    LEFT
    REPORT

Expected output:

    0,0,WEST

#### Example c

    PLACE 1,2,EAST
    MOVE
    MOVE
    LEFT
    MOVE
    REPORT

Expected output

    3,3,NORTH

### Deliverables

Please provide your source code, and any test code/data you using in
developing your solution.

Please engineer your solution to a standard you consider suitable for
production. It is not required to provide any graphical output showing the
movement of the toy robot.

## Solution

### Stack

I knew that only a command line tool was required but I decided to put a very basic web command line tool together so the assessors did not have to do any set up to review the functioning of the application.

* Java 8
* Spring Boot
* Angular 1
* Angular Material
* Rest Web Service with HATEOAS
* Spring Data, JPA and Hibernate
* JUnit & Maven
* Amazon AWS

### Approach
1. I started by creating a very basic conceptual model, in which the concepts were the Robot and the Table and then created the model objects with relations and their variables.
2. I then stubbed a stateless service to create an instance of a robot and then another to issue commands for a a supplied robot based on the above requirements.
3. I then wired these service method into JUnit tests so I could test as I progressed.
4. I then added all the method logic into the methods and tested and bugfixed until my tests passed.
5. I then went and added more integration (sequence of events) type tests in JUnit, these test cases were drawn from the original requirement an asserted based on given outcomes.
6. I then implemented a REST service and a simple web interface in order to issue commands from and online tool so that the assessors did not require any local setup.
7. I then interacted with the web command line interface and did more human / user acceptance testing until I was happy with the result.

### Design
* The code design is fairly basic, there is a robot which can be placed on a table, the table may have any dimensions but default to 5 x 5, so a robot has a table that it has been placed one, but they can both exist without each other, or a robot can be moved to another table or the dimensions of the table can be amended at runtime.
* There is a robot service which is used to instantiate and return a new robot object with the default settings.
* There is then a robot command service which is used to issue commands for a robot, this is done by calling the relevant method on this service and supplying the robot you wish to command. This applies all the logic rules for the robot based on its variables (ie its location, direction and table size it has been placed on) in a single stateless location.
